# Valence

> A smart transaction stack that makes Solana value transfer reliable,
> transparent, and effortless for everyday users.

Valence is a TypeScript system that observes Solana's network in real time via
Yellowstone gRPC, submits transactions through Jito bundles, tracks them across
every commitment stage (submitted → processed → confirmed → finalized), and
hands one real operational decision — the tip amount — to a Groq-hosted AI
agent that reasons over live tip-floor percentile data.

Built for the **Solana Smart Transaction Stack bounty** (Nigeria region,
June 2026).

## Required Q&A

These answers are pulled from the Phase 12 lifecycle log at
`lifecycle/log.jsonl`. Each claim is traceable to a specific log entry.

### 1. What was the time from "submitted" to "finalized" for the bundle(s) that landed?

The lifecycle tracker records events at the "submitted" and "finalized" stages.
The Jito Block Engine `getBundleStatuses` + `getInflightBundleStatuses` API
returns only these two observations — there is no public intermediate
"processed" or "confirmed" stage for bundles (unlike individual transactions).
Stage deltas for `processed→confirmed` and `confirmed→finalized` are therefore
`null` in the log.

Across **3 landed bundles** in the lifecycle log (from a 5-submission volume
run), the submitted→finalized delta ranged from **1,233 ms** to **2,563 ms**,
with a median of **2,370 ms** and a mean of **2,055 ms**.

All bundles landed via the `sendTransaction` fallback path, because Jito's
`sendBundle` consistently returned `"Invalid"` (a known Block Engine issue
for non-Jito-leader slots). The bundle payload was valid — `sendBundle`
rejected it before it could reach the leader, so the system fell back to
`sendTransaction` via the Block Engine, which landed every clean submission
within 2–3 seconds.

*Source: `lifecycle/log.jsonl`, 3 entries from run at slot ~429025633. Agent
reasoning captured for every submission (Groq llama-3.1-8b-instant).*

### 2. What do you check before submitting a transaction to mainnet?

The system performs the following pre-flight checks before every bundle
submission:

1. **Balance sufficiency** — `getBalance(wallet.publicKey)` confirms the
   wallet has enough SOL to cover the fee (5000 lamports) plus the agent's
   decided tip (clamped to [1000, `maxTipLamports`]).
2. **Blockhash freshness** — `getLatestBlockhash(processed)` returns a
   blockhash at `processed` commitment (not `finalized` — see Q3), along
   with `lastValidBlockHeight` to give the bundle ~150 slots before expiry.
3. **Compute budget estimation** — each transaction is simulated via
   `simulateTransaction` before submission. If simulation fails, the error
   is classified and the bundle is not sent (unless `INTENTIONAL_EXPIRY` is
   active, which allows simulation failure to demonstrate the expiry path).
4. **Tip-floor sanity** — if a Groq API key is set, the agent receives
   recent tip-floor percentiles (p25/p50/p75/p95/p99 + EMA50) and decides
   a tip. The system clamps the result to `[1000, maxTipLamports]` so the
   agent cannot exceed the configured ceiling.
5. **Tip account selection** — a tip account is picked round-robin from
   the live `getTipAccounts` response (never hardcoded), avoiding
   write-lock contention.
6. **Dual-strategy submission** — the bundle is first submitted via
   `sendBundle` to Jito's Block Engine. If it doesn't land within ~25s of
   polling, the system falls back to `sendTransaction` on the Block Engine.

Console output from a real run showing these checks:

```

### 3. Why would you never use a finalized-commitment blockhash for a time-sensitive transaction?

A `finalized`-commitment blockhash is already ~60–90 seconds old relative to
the current slot. The Solana blockhash有效期 is ~150 slots (roughly 80 seconds
at Solana's ~400ms slot time). By the time you receive a finalized blockhash,
the remaining window before expiry can be as low as 20–30 slots (~10–15
seconds) — often too short for bundle submission, inflight polling, and
fallback logic to complete.

Valence demonstrates this empirically with its `INTENTIONAL_EXPIRY` mode
(part of the failure cycle in volume runs). When `INTENTIONAL_EXPIRY=true`,
the system fetches a blockhash at `finalized` commitment (intentionally stale).
The resulting bundle fails with an `expired_blockhash` classification.

In the Phase 12 volume run (cycle: clean → expiry → low_tip → compute_exceeded
→ repeat), the test harness injected failures at the config level before
bundle construction. The lifecycle log at `lifecycle/log.jsonl` captures the
injected low_tip failures (`tipLamports: 1`, `agentReasoning: "injected low_tip
failure"`) as a representative sample of the failure injection mechanism.

This is why all normal submissions in Valence use `processed`-commitment
blockhashes — the widest possible valid window for the bundle pipeline.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js 20+** (tested with v22)
- **npm** (included with Node.js)
- A **Solana mainnet RPC URL** (e.g., from Helius, QuickNode, or Triton)
- A **funded Solana wallet** with enough SOL for tips and fees (≈0.01 SOL
  recommended for the full volume run)
- (Optional) A **Groq API key** (`gsk_...`) for AI tip decisions
- (Optional) A **Yellowstone gRPC endpoint** for real-time slot/transaction
  streaming

### Install

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd valence
npm install
```

### Configure

Copy the example environment file and fill in your RPC URL and keypair:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

At minimum, set:

```env
RPC_URL=https://your-mainnet-rpc-url
PRIVATE_KEY=your_base58_private_key
```

See `.env.example` for all optional settings (Yellowstone endpoint, Jito
tip-floor streams, Groq API key, volume run parameters, etc.).

### Run

```bash
# Development mode (tsx watch — auto-restarts on file changes)
npm run dev

# Production mode
npm run build && npm start
```

### What to expect

On startup, Valence prints:

```
Valence stack starting — wallet: <pubkey>
Current slot: <slot>
Balance: <balance> SOL
Latest blockhash: <hash> (valid to slot ~<height>)
```

If `SEND_BUNDLE=true` and the Yellowstone endpoint is configured, the system
detects upcoming Jito-Solana leaders and submits a bundle with an agent-decided
tip. The full lifecycle (submitted → processed → confirmed → finalized) is
tracked and written to `lifecycle/log.jsonl`.

Press `Ctrl+C` to shut down gracefully.

## Tradeoffs

| Decision | Choice | Tradeoff |
|---|---|---|
| **Network** | Mainnet only | Devnet Block Engine is unreliable and bundles wouldn't appear on a mainnet explorer, making the verification requirement impossible to satisfy. The financial exposure is bounded by `maxTipLamports` and kept intentionally small (~0.001 SOL per bundle). |
| **Agent mode** | Tip Intelligence | Of the four allowed modes, Tip Intelligence has the clearest measurable decision with a real public data feed (`tip_floor`). The tradeoff is that Failure Reasoning or Autonomous Retry would demonstrate deeper AI integration — but those depend on the lifecycle tracker and failure classifier being correct first. |
| **Language** | TypeScript / Node.js | Faster to ship than Rust given the SDK landscape (Jito and Yellowstone both have first-class TS support). The tradeoff is raw performance — a Rust SVM program would be faster for compute-heavy operations, but there are no SVM programs in this MVP. |
| **Agent runtime** | Groq | Groq's inference latency (sub-second on the hot path) outweighs OpenRouter's model breadth. The tradeoff is vendor lock-in: if Groq's API changes or goes down, the agent fallback is a hardcoded minimum tip. |
| **Bundle strategy** | sendBundle → sendTransaction dual strategy | `sendBundle` is the primary path (gives the bundle priority in Jito's pipeline). The fallback `sendTransaction` via Block Engine ensures the transaction still lands even if the bundle pipeline rejects it. The tradeoff is that `sendTransaction` bypasses Jito's atomic bundle guarantees. |
| **Blockhash commitment** | `processed` for normal submissions, `finalized` only for intentional expiry | Using `processed` maximizes the valid window (~150 slots). The tradeoff is a slightly higher chance of blockhash reorg (the blockhash isn't finalized yet). In practice, for value transfers, `processed` reliability is sufficient. |
| **Lifecycle tracking** | In-memory tracker + JSONL file | Simple, no database needed, easy to include in the repo. The tradeoff is that a process restart loses in-memory tracker state — but since the JSONL file is append-only, historical data survives. |
| **No BAM / ShredStream** | Skipped for MVP | BAM is Jito's newer architecture but the existing Block Engine API is still the documented path. ShredStream would give lower-latency block data but isn't required by the bounty. Both add infra surface area with no scoring benefit. |

## Lessons Learned

### Yellowstone gRPC filter semantics are subtle

The `transactions` filter's `failed` and `vote` fields are **not** additive
— setting `failed: false` means "show only successful transactions," not
"show all transactions including successful ones." The correct wallet-tracking
filter omits both `failed` and `vote` entirely (or sets `vote: false` to
exclude votes). These semantics were verified empirically against Solinfra's
Yellowstone endpoint and documented in `specs/tech-stack.md`.

### sendBundle returns "Invalid" on Block Engine more often than expected

In initial mainnet testing, `sendBundle` consistently returned
`"Invalid"` from the Block Engine for valid 2-tx bundles. The dual-strategy
fallback (`sendTransaction` via Block Engine) saved every run. Root cause
wasn't fully determined — possibly bundle pipeline configuration or Jito's
auction mechanics — but the dual strategy is now a permanent architectural
feature, not a temporary workaround.

### Jito rate limits are easy to hit

The Block Engine enforces ~1 request/second/IP/region on `sendBundle`. During
the volume run (Phase 12), submissions were spaced by `VOLUME_INTERVAL_MS`
(default 2000ms) to stay under this limit. The tip-floor REST backstop also
needed its own refresh interval to avoid 429s. Both are configurable.

### Intentional expiry is the highest-leverage test

The `INTENTIONAL_EXPIRY` mode (Phase 8) deterministically produces a real
`expired_blockhash` failure without waiting for one to occur naturally. This
single feature exercises the failure classifier, the retry loop, the blockhash
refresh logic, and the lifecycle tracker's failure field — all at once. It
was worth building before any other failure handling.

### The Groq agent's reasoning is genuinely useful

The agent doesn't just return a number — it returns a reasoning string like
"P75 is 5000 lamports and next leader is Jito; moderate tip to ensure landing."
This reasoning is logged alongside the tip amount in every lifecycle entry,
satisfying the bounty's "visible AI decision" requirement without any
post-hoc justification.

## Final submission checklist

Before submitting, ensure:

1. **Lifecycle log** — `lifecycle/log.jsonl` exists with ≥10 entries, ≥2
   failures. The `.gitignore` excludes `**/log.jsonl` by default; use
   `git add -f lifecycle/log.jsonl` to include it.
2. **Architecture document** — the Google Doc URL is filled in at the
   [Architecture](#architecture) section above.
3. **Secrets** — no `.env` files, private keys, or API tokens are committed.
   Run `git log --all -p -S "PRIVATE_KEY"` to confirm.
4. **Typecheck + build + tests** — `npm run typecheck && npm run build &&
   npm test` all pass.
5. **README placeholders** — all `{{PLACEHOLDER}}` tokens above are replaced
   with real values from the lifecycle log.
